#include <iostream>

/*
    This is the Implementation of a string class with a private data member,
    which is a c-string called str and an int data member MAX_READ_SIZE.

    This object is designed to make working with sequences of characters
    a little more convenient and less error-prone than handling raw c-strings.
    The MyString class handles constructing strings, reading/printing, and
    accessing characters. In addition, the MyString object has the ability to
    make a full deep-copy of itself when copied.


    The following functions are available:


    MyString();
    post: The calling object has been created and initialized so that
    the str property is an empty char. Creates an empty MyString object


    MyString(const char *inString);
    post: The calling object has been created and initialized so that
    the str equals the inString. Copies the string data.

    MyString(const MyString& deepCopyMe);
    post: The calling object has been created and initialized so that
    the str equals the passed in MyString object str

    MyString operator=(const MyString& right);
    post: If the object on the right is not the calling object, the
    calling object is deep copied from the object on the right


    ~MyString();
    Called automatically when an object on the stack is deallocated
    post: deallocate any memory on the heap that the object is pointing to

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const MyString& source);
    post: Prints out the characters of a MyString

    friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& in, MyString& target);
    pre: This function will only read in 127 characters max
    post: Ignores leading spaces and then reads characters into the string up to
    the first whitespace character


    friend bool operator<(const MyString& left, const MyString& right);
    post: Returns true if the left MyString is less than right MyString.
    Otherwise returns false. The ordering is based on ASCII values.

    friend bool operator<=(const MyString& left, const MyString& right);
    post: Returns true if the left MyString is less than or equal to
    right MyString. Otherwise returns false. The ordering is based on ASCII values.

    friend bool operator>(const MyString& left, const MyString& right);
    post: Returns true if the left MyString is greater than the right MyString.
    Otherwise returns false. The ordering is based on ASCII values.

    friend bool operator>=(const MyString& left, const MyString& right);
    post: Returns true if the left MyString is greater than or equal to
    right MyString. Otherwise returns false. The ordering is based on ASCII values.

    friend bool operator==(const MyString& left, const MyString& right);
    post: Returns true if the left MyString equals right MyString.
    Otherwise returns false. The ordering is based on ASCII values.

    friend bool operator!=(const MyString& left, const MyString& right);
    post: Returns true if the left MyString does not equal right MyString.
    Otherwise returns false. The ordering is based on ASCII values.

    friend MyString operator+(const MyString& left, const MyString& right);
    post: returns a concatenated string made using left MyString and
    right MyString

    MyString operator+=(const MyString& right);
    pre: only MyStrings can be on the left-hand side of a += operation,
    but either MyStrings or C-strings may appear on the right side
    post: the calling MyString is incremented with the right MyString and is returned


    char operator[](int index) const;
    pre: index is bound within the range 0 to length of the calling MyString
    post: returns the character at a specific index


    char& operator[](int index);
    pre: index is bound within the range 0 to length of the calling MyString
    post: returns the client a reference to the char at a specfic index


    int length() const;
    post: returns the length of a MyString c-string


    void read(std::istream& in, char delimiter);
    pre: This function will read in 127 characters max
    post: Allows the client programmer to specify the delimiting character
    Places everything up to but not including the delimiting character into
    the calling object
