/*
 Write a program that plays a number guessing game with a Human user. The Human user will think of a number between 1 and 100, inclusive. The program will make guesses and the user will tell the program to guess higher or lower.
 
 h = high;
 l = low;
 c = correct;
 
 A sample run of the program might look like this:
 
 Ready to play (y/n)? y
 Think of a number between 1 and 100.
 Is it 50 (h/l/c)? h
 Is it 75 (h/l/c)? h
 Is it 88 (h/l/c)? l
 Is it 81 (h/l/c)? c
 Great! Do you want to play again (y/n)? y
 Think of a number between 1 and 100.
 Is it 50 (h/l/c)? l
 Is it 25 (h/l/c)? h
 Is it 37 (h/l/c)? c
 Great! Do you want to play again (y/n)? n
